	    <p class="fragment">This problem is usually addressed via the reductions of Phosphorous (P), based on the fact that Phosphorous is a harder to come-by limiting nutrient and thus when available algal blooms take full advantage of it.</p>

	  <h1>Q & A</h1>
	  <p>with Paerl et al.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <section>
	    <p> Which nutrients control eutrophication and HAB? </p>
	    <p class="fragment">Short answer: Both N and P.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section data-background-image="img/tango.png" data-background-size="1000px" data-background-opacity=".1">
	    <p>Long answer: Life is not black and white, which is to say that these nutrients are intertwined in a <b>nutrient tango</b>. Reducing one can thus reduce the other.
	    <p class="fragment">Phosporous is necessary for nitrogenase, the enzyme that fixes N$_2$. Recall that the energy required comes from the binding and hydrolysis of ATP.</p>
	    <img class="fragment" src="img/atp.png">
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p class="fragment">Reactive N is needed for other plant enzymes in order for them to respire and fix carbon.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Thus N depends on P!</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Can you think of other ways these nutrients are connected?</p>
	  </section>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <section>
	    <p>With regards to nutrient overenrichment, should we be concerned about all types of cyanobacteria?</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Short answer: Yes.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p>
	      Long answer: At Lake Erie, <b>Microcystis</b> are prominet examples of cyanobacteria that are harmful and reactive N hungry,
	    </p>
	    <p class="fragment">that is they don't fix their own and thus are "flourishing" due to the lack of controls in N.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section data-background="img/bluegreenalgae.mgif">
	    <p>Another cyanobacterium contributing to HAB pollution is an N-fixing one: <b>Cylindrospermopsis</b>.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Surprised?</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Imagine you are a bacterium and suddenly there is free nitrogen on the house - even if you are not a bacterium, it's free! The paper calls these guys reluctant N$_2$ fixers, I would call them reasonable.</p>

	    <p>What nutrients are associated with more toxic (cyanobacterial) algal blooms?</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Short Answer: NH$_4^+$</p>

	  </section>
	  <section data-background-image="img/Okeechobee.jpg"  data-background-opacity=".3">
	    <p class="fragment">Long answer: The form of N-source can influence the structure of planktonic communities in aquatic ecosystems. Studies suggest that reduced forms of N - such as NH4+ - promote the growth of toxin producing cyanobacteria.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Recall that urease can convert urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Ammonia can dissolve in water into ammonium ions: H$_2$O + NH$_3$ $\rightleftharpoons$ OH$^-$ + NH$_4^+$</p>

	    <p>Lake Okeechobee was dominated by Anabaena cyanobacteria in the 1980s, but now is dominated by the Microcystis genius.</p>

	  <section data-background-image="img/Okeechobee.jpg"  data-background-opacity=".3">
	    <p class="fragment">Nitrogen is often the best predictor of toxin concentrations in lakes.</p>
            <p class="fragment">When developing regulations on N concentrations, policy makers should also consider the form of N entering our water bodies.</p>

	</section>
	<section>
	  <section>
	    <p> How much improvement can be attained by reducing N in addition to P?</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Short answer: 5 of 9.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Shorter answer: much.</p>
	    <p class="fragment">Seriously: Let's just look at table 5.</p>

	    <h1>Discussion Questions</h1>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <ol>
	      <li class="fragment">Why have N inputs not been yet a matter of debate? In other words, why did they only focus on controlling P in lakes in the past?</li>
	      <li class="fragment">Do you think N inputs will be more difficult to control than P inputs? (i.e, N has gaseous form, whereas P doesn’t?</li>
	      <li class="fragment">Should we only focus on regulating one form of N (such as urea and NH$_4^+$) in addition to P? Do you think other forms of N could also harm water quality, such as NO$_3^-?$</li>
	      </ol>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <ol>
	      <li class="fragment">One of the examples of successful N and P loading reductions given in Table 1 was dredging to remove both nitrogen and phosphorus. Could dredging be damaging to ecosystems?</li>
	      <li class="fragment">Are all blooms resultant from human activities? Should we regulate them all regardless of source?</li>
	      <li class="fragment">What might be some good ways to educate the population about nutrient loading of nitrogen and phosphorous? What intrinsic values could we find in managing nutrient loads?</li>
	      </ol>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <ol>
	      <li class="fragment">One obvious barrier to reducing inputs on a large scale would be economic (i.e. agricultural reliance on fertilizers). How might we curb nutrient inputs into large-scale watersheds like these without reducing the amount of fertilizer we use?</li>
	      <li class="fragment">The paper argued that only mandating input reductions in only one nutrient was “irresponsible on many socioeconomic levels.” What different socioeconomic levels could they be referring to?</li>
